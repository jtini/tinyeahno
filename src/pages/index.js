    <p>Barbershop hired an independent contractor to re-design our website, which led to a larger discussion of how we present ourselves to potential clients and partners. Using the website redesign as a jumping-off point, I worked with Barbershopâ€™s leadership to create a digital style guide and resource repository to make it easier for our team to collaborate on internal projects.</p>
